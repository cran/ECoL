\title{Measures of class balance}
\usage{
balance(...)

\method{balance}{default}(x, y, measures = "all", ...)

\method{balance}{formula}(formula, data, measures = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Not used.}

\item{x}{A data.frame contained only the input attributes.}

\item{y}{A factor response vector with one label for each row/component of x.}

\item{measures}{A list of measures names or \code{"all"} to include all them.}

\item{formula}{A formula to define the class column.}

\item{data}{A data.frame dataset contained the input attributes and class.}
}
\value{
A list named by the requested class balance measure.
}
\description{
Classification task. These measures capture the differences in the number of 
examples per class in the dataset. When these differences are severe, 
problems related to generalization of the ML classification techniques could 
happen because of the imbalance ratio.
}
\details{
The following measures are allowed for this method:
 \describe{
   \item{"C1"}{The entropy of class proportions (C1) capture the imbalance in
     a dataset based on the proportions of examples per class.}
   \item{"C2"}{The imbalance ratio (C2) is an index computed for measuring
     class balance. This is a version of the measure that is also suited for 
     multiclass classification problems.}
 }
